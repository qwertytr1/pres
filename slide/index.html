				<p>In today's presentation, I will consider Blockchain technology, because the technology is still
					developing, it is considered new and is just beginning to be applied. Therefore, I think that this
					will be an interesting topic.</p>

				<h3>Blockchain</h3>
			</section>
			<section>In 2008, an unknown person or group of people under the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto embodied
				blockchain technology in its modern form. For Bitcoin transactions, Satoshi limited the size of blocks
				of information to 1 MB.</section>

				<h3>Blockchain Overview</h3>
				<p>Overview consists of 2 stages:</p>

				<h3>Types of blockchain networks</h3>
				<p>There are several ways to build a blockchain network. They can be public, private, permissioned or
					built by a consortium.</p>
			</section>
			<section>
				<h3>Speaker Notes</h3>
				<section>
					<h3>Blockchain defined</h3>
					<p>Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger that facilitates the process of recording transactions
						and
						tracking assets in a business network. An asset can be tangible (a house, car, cash, land) or
						intangible (intellectual property, patents, copyrights, branding). Virtually anything of value
						can
						be tracked and traded on a blockchain network, reducing risk and cutting costs for all involved.
					</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Why blockchain is important</h3>
					<p>Business runs on information. The faster it’s received and the more accurate it is, the better.
						Blockchain is ideal for delivering that information because it provides immediate, shared and
						completely transparent information stored on an immutable ledger that can be accessed only by
						permissioned network members. A blockchain network can track orders, payments, accounts,
						production
						and much more. And because members share a single view of the truth, you can see all details of
						a
						transaction end to end, giving you greater confidence, as well as new efficiencies and
						opportunities.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Distributed ledger technology</h3>
					<p> All network participants have access to the distributed ledger and its immutable record of
						transactions. With this shared ledger, transactions are recorded only once, eliminating the
						duplication of effort that’s typical of traditional business networks.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Immutable records</h3>
					<p> No participant can change or tamper with a transaction after it’s been recorded to the shared
						ledger. If a transaction record includes an error, a new transaction must be added to reverse
						the error, and both transactions are then visible.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Smart contracts</h3>
					<p>To speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart contract — is stored on the blockchain and
						executed automatically. A smart contract can define conditions for corporate bond transfers,
						include terms for travel insurance to be paid and much more.</p>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h3>As each transaction occurs, it is recorded as a “block” of data</h3>
					<p>Those transactions show the movement of an asset that can be tangible (a product) or
						intangible (intellectual). The data block can record the information of your choice: who,
						what, when, where, how much and even the condition — such as the temperature of a food
						shipment.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Each block is connected to the ones before and after it</h3>
					<p>These blocks form a chain of data as an asset moves from place to place or ownership changes
						hands. The blocks confirm the exact time and sequence of transactions, and the blocks link
						securely together to prevent any block from being altered or a block being inserted between
						two existing blocks.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Transactions are blocked together in an irreversible chain: a blockchain</h3>
					<p>Each additional block strengthens the verification of the previous block and hence the entire
						blockchain. This renders the blockchain tamper-evident, delivering the key strength of
						immutability. This removes the possibility of tampering by a malicious actor — and builds a
						ledger of transactions you and other network members can trust.</p>
				</section>
				<section>What needs to change: Operations often waste effort on duplicate record keeping and third-party
					validations. Record-keeping systems can be vulnerable to fraud and cyberattacks. Limited
					transparency can slow data verification. And with the arrival of IoT, transaction volumes have
					exploded. All of this slows business, drains the bottom line — and means we need a better way. Enter
					blockchain.</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Greater trust</h3>
					<p>With blockchain, as a member of a members-only network, you can rest assured that you are
						receiving accurate and timely data, and that your confidential blockchain records will be shared
						only with network members to whom you have specifically granted access.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Greater security</h3>
					<p>Consensus on data accuracy is required from all network members, and all validated transactions
						are immutable because they are recorded permanently. No one, not even a system administrator,
						can delete a transaction.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>More efficiencies</h3>
					<p>With a distributed ledger that is shared among members of a network, time-wasting record
						reconciliations are eliminated. And to speed transactions, a set of rules — called a smart
						contract — can be stored on the blockchain and executed automatically.</p>
				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Public blockchain networks</h3>
					<p>A public blockchain is one that anyone can join and participate in, such as Bitcoin. Drawbacks
						might include substantial computational power required, little or no privacy for transactions,
						and weak security. These are important considerations for enterprise use cases of blockchain.
					</p>


				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Private blockchain networks</h3>
					<p>A private blockchain network, similar to a public blockchain network, is a decentralized
						peer-to-peer network. However, one organization governs the network, controlling who is allowed
						to participate, execute a consensus protocol and maintain the shared ledger. Depending on the
						use case, this can significantly boost trust and confidence between participants. A private
						blockchain can be run behind a corporate firewall and even be hosted on premises.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Permissioned blockchain networks</h3>
					<p>Businesses who set up a private blockchain will generally set up a permissioned blockchain
						network. It is important to note that public blockchain networks can also be permissioned. This
						places restrictions on who is allowed to participate in the network and in what transactions.
						Participants need to obtain an invitation or permission to join.</p>

				</section>
				<section>
					<h3>Consortium blockchains</h3>
					<p>Multiple organizations can share the responsibilities of maintaining a blockchain. These
						pre-selected organizations determine who may submit transactions or access the data. A
						consortium blockchain is ideal for business when all participants need to be permissioned and
						have a shared responsibility for the blockchain.</p>
